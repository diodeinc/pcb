## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.21] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Add v2 dependency resolution support to `pcb test`

### Changed

- Use source layout directly in release instead of separate copy
- Change extra footprint sync diagnostic from error to warning
- Show module path and FPID in layout sync diagnostics (extra_footprint, missing_footprint, fpid_mismatch)
- `pcb layout` now auto-replaces footprints when FPID changes (preserving position and nets)
- Speed up workspace discovery by pruning unrelated directories

### Fixed

- Fix `pcb layout --check` only reporting first extra footprint instead of all
- Fix inconsistent handling of invalid pcb.toml files between `pcb build` and `pcb publish`
- Fix fp-lib-table in release staging to use vendored paths instead of .pcb/cache
- Create `<workspace>/.pcb/cache` symlink pointing to `~/.pcb/cache` for stable paths

## [0.3.20] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Add `pcb route` command for auto-routing using DeepPCB
- Detect footprint sync issues (FPID mismatch, missing/extra components) during layout

### Changed

- Skip version prompt for unpublished packages in `pcb publish` (always 0.1.0)
- Error on path dependencies that point to workspace members
- Error on pcb.toml parse failures

### Fixed

- Fix asset resolution to check vendor directory before cache
- Fix inconsistent vendoring with folder assets and subfiles
- Fix TUI package details not loading after fresh index download

## [0.3.19] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Add `pcb fork` subcommands (`add`, `remove`, `upstream`) for local package forking
- Add TUI mode to `pcb search` for browsing registry packages

### Changed
