The zener VSCode extension brings powerful schematic visualization directly into your Visual Studio Code workflow. With this extension, you can open `.zen` files and instantly see them rendered as interactive, traditional schematicsâ€”making it easier to understand, debug, and share your designs.

Some key features include:

- **Live Preview:** As you edit your `.zen` files, the schematic view updates in real time, so you can immediately see the impact of your changes.
- **Error Highlighting:** Syntax and connection errors are visually flagged, helping you catch mistakes early.
