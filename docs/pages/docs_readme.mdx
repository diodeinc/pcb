# README

Every board/package gets a `README.md` at its root (`pcb new` creates one from a template). READMEs are the first thing someone reads — keep them practical and current.

## Board README

Boards are top-level designs that get manufactured. Their READMEs orient someone who needs to build, flash, or test the board.

```markdown
# <BoardName>

One or two sentences: what it does, key specs.

## Features

- Feature one
- Feature two

## Build Instructions

\`\`\`bash
pcb build boards/<BoardName>
pcb layout boards/<BoardName>
\`\`\`

## License

MIT (or whatever applies)
```

**Required sections:** Description (main MCU/IC, key interfaces, form factor), Features (scannable bullet list), Build instructions (`pcb build`/`pcb layout` commands plus any non-obvious prerequisites), License.

**Optional sections** (include only when useful): Pin Configuration, Design Notes, Related (datasheets, reference designs).

## Package README

Packages are reusable modules/components other designs depend on. Answer: what does this export, and how do I use it?

```markdown
# <package_name>

One or two sentences: what this package provides.

## Usage

\`\`\`python
load("<package_name>.zen", "SymbolName")
\`\`\`

## Exported Symbols

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BuckConverter` | Adjustable step-down converter with configurable output voltage |
| `LDO` | Low-dropout linear regulator |

## Configuration

\`\`\`python
converter = BuckConverter(
    v_out = Voltage(3.3),
    i_max = Current(2.0),
)
\`\`\`
```

**Required sections:** Description (what it provides, when to use it), Usage (`load()` statement with actual symbol names), Exported symbols (table of every public symbol with one-line description).

**Optional sections:** Configuration (example `config()` parameters), Dependencies (non-obvious ones), Design Notes (thermal, layout constraints).

## Writing Style

- **Be concise.** One sentence beats a paragraph that says the same thing.
- **Keep it current.** Update the README in the same commit as the design change.
- **Use backticks for identifiers.** Symbol names, file names, CLI commands, pin names.
- **Delete empty sections.** Don't leave `<!-- TODO -->` placeholders.

## Complete Examples

### Board

```markdown
# DM0001

Motor controller board with STM32F4, dual CAN bus, and hardware ESTOP circuit.
Designed for 12V systems with up to 4A continuous motor drive.

## Features

- STM32F446 MCU with 180MHz Cortex-M4F
- Dual CAN bus with independent termination
- Hardware ESTOP with debounce and LED indicator
- 3.3V and 1.8V regulated rails from 12V input
- SWD debug header and UART console

## Build Instructions

\`\`\`bash
pcb build boards/DM0001
pcb layout boards/DM0001

### Package

```markdown
# power_supply

Configurable switch-mode power supply modules for common topologies.

## Usage

\`\`\`python
load("power_supply.zen", "BuckConverter", "BoostConverter")
\`\`\`

## Exported Symbols

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BuckConverter` | Step-down converter, 4.5–28V input, adjustable output |
| `BoostConverter` | Step-up converter, 2.5–5.5V input, up to 12V output |
| `BuckBoost` | Buck-boost converter for inputs above or below output |

## Configuration

\`\`\`python
reg = BuckConverter(
    v_in = Voltage(12),
    v_out = Voltage(3.3),
    i_max = Current(3.0),
    switching_freq = Frequency(500_000),
)
\`\`\`
```
