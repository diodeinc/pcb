# README

Every board and package gets a `README.md` at its root. The `pcb new` command creates one from a template. READMEs are the first thing someone reads when they encounter your package — keep them practical and up to date.

## Board README

Boards are top-level designs that get built and manufactured. Their READMEs orient someone who needs to build, flash, or test the board.

```markdown
# <BoardName>

One or two sentences describing what this board does and its key specs.

## Features

- Feature one
- Feature two

## Build Instructions

\`\`\`bash
pcb build boards/<BoardName>
pcb layout boards/<BoardName>
\`\`\`

## License

MIT (or whatever applies)
```

### What to Include

**Description.** What the board does, the main MCU/IC, key interfaces (CAN, SPI, USB, etc.), and form factor if relevant.

**Features.** Bulleted list of the board's capabilities. Keep it scannable.

**Build instructions.** The `pcb build` and `pcb layout` commands. Add any prerequisites (specific `pcb` version, required dependencies) if they're not obvious from `pcb.toml`.

**License.** Required for open-source packages. One line is enough.

### Optional Sections

Add these when they're useful — don't include empty sections:

- **Pin Configuration** — table of external connectors and their pinouts
- **Design Notes** — architectural decisions, constraints, or gotchas
- **Related** — links to datasheets, reference designs, or companion boards

## Package README

Packages are reusable modules and components that other designs depend on. Their READMEs need to answer: what does this export, and how do I use it?

```markdown
# <package_name>

One or two sentences describing what this package provides.

## Usage

\`\`\`python
load("<package_name>.zen", "SymbolName")
\`\`\`

## Exported Symbols

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BuckConverter` | Adjustable step-down converter with configurable output voltage |
| `LDO` | Low-dropout linear regulator |

## Configuration

\`\`\`python
converter = BuckConverter(
    v_out = Voltage(3.3),
    i_max = Current(2.0),
)
\`\`\`
```

### What to Include

**Description.** What the package provides and when you'd use it.

**Usage.** A `load()` statement showing how to import the package. Use the actual symbol names.

**Exported symbols.** Table listing every public symbol with a one-line description. This is the API surface — keep it complete and accurate.

### Optional Sections

- **Configuration** — example showing `config()` parameters if the module is configurable
- **Dependencies** — note any unusual dependencies that aren't obvious from `pcb.toml`
- **Design Notes** — implementation details relevant to users (e.g., thermal considerations, layout constraints)

## Writing Style

**Be concise.** READMEs are reference material, not tutorials. One sentence that says what something does is better than a paragraph that says the same thing.

**Keep it current.** An outdated README is worse than no README. When you change the design, update the README in the same commit.

**Use backticks for identifiers.** Symbol names, file names, CLI commands, pin names — anything that's a literal identifier gets backticks.

**Skip empty sections.** The template includes placeholder sections. Delete any that don't apply rather than leaving `<!-- TODO -->` comments.

## Complete Example

### Board

```markdown
# DM0001

Motor controller board with STM32F4, dual CAN bus, and hardware ESTOP circuit.
Designed for 12V systems with up to 4A continuous motor drive.

## Features

- STM32F446 MCU with 180MHz Cortex-M4F
- Dual CAN bus with independent termination
- Hardware ESTOP with debounce and LED indicator
- 3.3V and 1.8V regulated rails from 12V input
- SWD debug header and UART console

## Build Instructions

\`\`\`bash
pcb build boards/DM0001
pcb layout boards/DM0001

### Package

```markdown
# power_supply

Configurable switch-mode power supply modules for common topologies.

## Usage

\`\`\`python
load("power_supply.zen", "BuckConverter", "BoostConverter")
\`\`\`

## Exported Symbols

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BuckConverter` | Step-down converter, 4.5–28V input, adjustable output |
| `BoostConverter` | Step-up converter, 2.5–5.5V input, up to 12V output |
| `BuckBoost` | Buck-boost converter for inputs above or below output |

## Configuration

\`\`\`python
reg = BuckConverter(
    v_in = Voltage(12),
    v_out = Voltage(3.3),
    i_max = Current(3.0),
    switching_freq = Frequency(500_000),
)
\`\`\`
```
