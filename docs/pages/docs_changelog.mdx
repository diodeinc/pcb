# Changelog

Every board and package gets a `CHANGELOG.md` at its root. The `pcb new` command creates one automatically. Changelogs are parsed by `pcb publish` for release notes and by the build system for CLI display, so the format matters.

## Format

Follow [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The structure is simple:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- New features.

### Changed

- Changes to existing behavior.

### Fixed

- Bug fixes.

### Removed

- Removed features.
```

## Rules

**`[Unreleased]` goes first.** Always keep an `## [Unreleased]` section at the top. Add entries here as you work. When you publish, `pcb publish` moves these into a versioned section with today's date.

**One entry per user-visible change.** Each bullet should describe a single change from the user's perspective. Internal refactors that don't affect behavior don't need entries.

**Use the four categories.** `Added` for new features, `Changed` for behavior changes, `Fixed` for bug fixes, `Removed` for removed features. Omit empty categories.

**Newest version first.** Version sections are in reverse chronological order.

**Write for the person upgrading.** They want to know: what changed, whether it affects them, and what they need to do (if anything). Lead with the *what*, not the *why*.

## Writing Good Entries

Each entry is a single line starting with `- `. Describe the change concisely. Include enough context that someone unfamiliar with the PR can understand the impact.

Good:
```markdown
- `Component()` now infers missing `footprint` from symbol `Footprint` property.
- Fix `layout.sync` false positives caused by `.kicad_pro` newline drift.
```

Avoid:
```markdown
- Updated code.
- Fixed bug.
- Refactored internals (no user-visible change).
```

Use backticks for identifiers: function names, file names, config keys, CLI commands.

## Versioning

Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **Patch** (0.3.1 → 0.3.2): Metadata only — docs, property typos, manufacturer aliases. No connectivity or behavior changes.
- **Minor** (0.3.x → 0.4.0): New functionality that doesn't break existing designs — optional pins, new config options, additional footprint variants.
- **Major** (0.x → 1.0): Breaking changes that may require design updates — changed pin definitions, restructured interfaces, removed features.

For pre-1.0 packages, `pcb publish` bumps the minor version (0.3.2 → 0.4.0) since minor versions are treated as potentially breaking.

## Tooling

The changelog is consumed in two places:

1. **`pcb publish`** — reads `CHANGELOG.md` to generate release notes for the annotated git tag. The `[Unreleased]` section becomes the release body.
2. **Build-time extraction** — the CLI parses the project changelog at compile time for `pcb doc --changelog` output. The parser expects `## [...]` version headers and `### Category` subsections.

Both parsers are strict about the heading format. Use exactly `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` for versions and `## [Unreleased]` for the working section.
