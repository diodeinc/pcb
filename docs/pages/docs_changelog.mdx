# Changelog

Every board/package gets a `CHANGELOG.md` at its root (`pcb new` creates one). Parsed by `pcb publish` for release notes and by the build system for CLI display, so format matters.

## Format

Follow [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/):

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- New features.

### Changed

- Changes to existing behavior.

### Fixed

- Bug fixes.

### Removed

- Removed features.
```

## Rules

- **`[Unreleased]` first.** Add entries here as you work. `pcb publish` moves them into a versioned section with today's date.
- **One entry per user-visible change.** Internal refactors with no behavior change don't need entries.
- **Four categories only.** `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`. Omit empty ones.
- **Newest version first.** Reverse chronological order.
- **Write for the upgrader.** Lead with *what* changed, not *why*. Note if action is needed.

## Writing Entries

Each entry is `- ` followed by a concise description. Use backticks for identifiers.

Good:
```markdown
- `Component()` now infers missing `footprint` from symbol `Footprint` property.
- Fix `layout.sync` false positives caused by `.kicad_pro` newline drift.
```

Avoid:
```markdown
- Updated code.
- Fixed bug.
- Refactored internals (no user-visible change).
```

## Versioning

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **Patch** (0.3.1 → 0.3.2): Metadata only — docs, property typos, manufacturer aliases. No connectivity or behavior changes.
- **Minor** (0.3.x → 0.4.0): New non-breaking functionality — optional pins, new config options, additional footprint variants.
- **Major** (0.x → 1.0): Breaking changes requiring design updates — changed pin definitions, restructured interfaces, removed features.

Pre-1.0: `pcb publish` bumps minor (0.3.2 → 0.4.0) since minor versions are treated as potentially breaking.

## Tooling

1. **`pcb publish`** — reads `[Unreleased]` as the release body for the annotated git tag.
2. **Build-time extraction** — CLI parses changelog at compile time for `pcb doc --changelog`. Expects `## [...]` version headers and `### Category` subsections.

Both parsers are strict: use exactly `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` for versions and `## [Unreleased]` for the working section.
