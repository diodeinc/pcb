# Bringup Documentation

Write a `README.md` per board version documenting reworks, firmware flashing, and test procedures. Diode Glass parses these and renders them in the **bringup** tab.

## File Location

```
src/boards/<BOARD_NAME>/
  bringup/
    v1.0/
      README.md
      images/
        estop-rework.png
    v2.0/
      README.md
```

One `README.md` per version folder. Images go in `images/` alongside the README.

### Version Matching

- **Exact**: release `v2.0` → folder `v2.0/`
- **Prefix**: release `v2.0.4` → folder `v2.0/` (covers all v2.0.x)
- **No cross-minor**: release `v2.1.0` does NOT match `v2.0/`

New folder per minor version. Patch versions share a folder unless they have unique rework. Docs are fetched from `main`, not the release artifact.

## Document Structure

```markdown
# <Board> <Version> Bringup

Overview text.

## Reworks

### 1. Title of first rework

...

### 2. Title of second rework

...

## Firmware

Free-form markdown.

## Testing

Free-form markdown.
```

`## Reworks` is parsed into structured data. All other `##` sections render as collapsible markdown.

## Rework Items

Each rework is a `### N. Title` heading followed by free-form prose. Describe the problem, fix, and board location naturally. Mention status in the text or heading (e.g., "fixed in v1.1") rather than a structured field.

### Linking to Components

Use markdown links with the `pcb://` scheme: `[R1](pcb://R1)`, `[C5](pcb://C5)`, `[U3](pcb://U3)`. The parser links these to the PCB viewer for click-to-highlight.

### Images

Place in `./images/`, reference with `![description](./images/photo.png)`.

## Complete Example

```markdown
# DM0001 v1.0 Bringup

Board version v1.0 requires 3 reworks before bringup.
Items 1–2 are fixed in v1.1. Item 3 requires a physical fix on each board.

## Reworks

### 1. Short ESTOP debounce resistor (fixed in v1.1)

The 47k ESTOP debounce resistor [R_ESTOP_DEBOUNCE](pcb://R_ESTOP_DEBOUNCE) creates a voltage
divider with the ESTOP LED, pulling the signal to ~1.5V (below the AND gate
VIH threshold of 2.0V). Short across [R_ESTOP_DEBOUNCE](pcb://R_ESTOP_DEBOUNCE) (47k 0402) with
a solder blob or wire. Located near the ESTOP connector between ESTOP_RAW
and ESTOP nets.

### 2. Replace decoupling capacitors (fixed in v1.1)

[C5](pcb://C5) and [C6](pcb://C6) have insufficient 10uF decoupling for [U1](pcb://U1) LDO.
Replace both with 22uF/16V X5R (GRM188R61C226ME15). Bottom side, adjacent
to [U1](pcb://U1).

### 3. CAN termination resistor

[R12](pcb://R12) footprint is unpopulated. Add 120 ohm 0402 resistor for CAN bus
termination.

## Firmware

### Prerequisites

- J-Link programmer
- Firmware v1.0.2: `dm0001-v1.0.2.bin`

### Flash Procedure

1. Connect J-Link to SWD header [J5](pcb://J5)
2. Power board via 12V supply
3. Run: `JFlash -openprj dm0001.jflash -open dm0001-v1.0.2.bin -auto -exit`
4. Verify: LED [D1](pcb://D1) should blink at 1Hz after flash

## Testing

### Power Rail Verification

| Rail | Test Point | Expected | Tolerance |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 3.3V | [TP1](pcb://TP1) | 3.30V | ±50mV |
| 1.8V | [TP2](pcb://TP2) | 1.80V | ±30mV |
| 5.0V | [TP3](pcb://TP3) | 5.00V | ±100mV |

### CAN Bus Test

1. Connect CAN analyzer to [J2](pcb://J2)
2. Send test frame: ID=0x100, DLC=8, data=0xFF
3. Board should echo back on ID=0x101 within 10ms

### ESTOP Functional Test

1. Short ESTOP connector pins 1-2
2. Verify ESTOP_OUT test point reads 3.3V (after rework #1)
3. Open ESTOP connector
4. Verify ESTOP_OUT reads 0V
