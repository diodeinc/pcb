Ground is a social construct.
The datasheet is aspirational fiction.
Electronics run on magic smoke. It's load-bearing.
Capacitors are just batteries with commitment issues.
A resistor is a heater cosplaying as a circuit element.

Works in simulation is not a valid test report.
If you're not oscillating, you're not pushing hard enough.
The schematic is a suggestion. The layout is what actually happened.

Buck, boost, or buck-boost? Yes.
The thermal pad is structural, not decorative.
RF is astrology for people with math degrees.
The Smith chart is a ouija board with impedance.
Your spectrum analyzer lies less than your scope. That's the nicest thing about it.
Never trust a capacitor. It's holding a grudge at 400 volts.
Datasheet ratings are what the part might do if it likes you.
The soldering iron tip is too big. Unless it's too small.
The probe is guilty until proven innocent.
Datasheets are written by people who forgot what it's like to not know.
Application notes are written by people who gave up explaining.
A schematic without a ground symbol is conceptual art with a budget.
Green soldermask is the only correct soldermask.
The BOM was final three revisions ago.
Ground bounce sounds fun. It isn't.
The fastest way to find a short is to apply power and follow the smoke.
Decoupling capacitors: scatter like seeds, hope like a farmer.
The errata is the real datasheet. The datasheet is marketing.
Every connector will be inserted backwards by someone with a deadline.
Clock skew is time travel for signals that didn't ask for it.
The thermal via is innocent. Leave it alone.
The footprint is wrong. It has always been wrong. It will be wrong again.
Silkscreen text hides under components like it owes them money.
Ferrite beads are thoughts and prayers in component form.
The crosstalk is coming from inside the board.
Four layers is comfort. Two layers is violence.
The prototype worked because the wires were too short to misbehave.
That's not ringing, it's personality.
Your power supply has more ripple than a flag in a hurricane.
I2C works great with two devices. The third one is cursed.
SPI is I2C for people who think more wires solve problems.
USB: Universal Serial "But why won't it enumerate?"
Your PLL will lock on the fifth power cycle. Not before.
Quantization error is just the ADC rounding down your dreams.
The DAC output looks great until you zoom in and start crying.
Op-amps are ideal until you read the input bias current spec.
Stability margins are just optimism with math.
The Bode plot tells the truth. You just don't want to hear it.
The notch filter worked in simulation. Simulation was lying.
Your antenna is a heater that occasionally transmits.
The near field is chaos. The far field is physics pretending to be calm.
Shielding works until someone cuts a slot for a cable.
The cable is the antenna you forgot to design.

Clock recovery is necromancy for bit streams.
DDR timing is astrology but the horoscope is always bad.
The simulator and silicon have creative differences.
The via stitching looked excessive until it wasn't.
Autorouter output is modern art you have to manually fix.
Your diff pairs broke up somewhere around layer 3.
The reference plane has a gap. The gap has opinions.
Trace width calculators assume you're not lying about your stackup.
The stackup is whatever the fab felt like that day.
Controlled impedance is a gentleman's agreement with your fab.
You didn't check DRC because you were afraid of what it would say.
The annular ring is too small. It's always too small.
Tombstoning: when your 0402 decides to do yoga during reflow.
The 0201 went somewhere. You'll find it in six months. In your eye.
